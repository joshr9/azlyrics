    All my life though some have changed"

    Some forever not for better"</p>

    Some have gone and some remain"</p>

    All these places have their moments"</p>

    Some are dead and some are living"</p>

    In my life I've loved them all"</p>

    But of all these friends and lovers"</p>

    "
    There is no one compares with you"</p>
    <p>
    "
    And these memories lose their meaning"</p>

    "
    When I think of love as something new"</p>

    Though I know I'll never lose affection"</p>

    For people and things that went before"</p>

    I know I'll often stop and think about them"</p>

    "
    In my life I love you more"</p>
